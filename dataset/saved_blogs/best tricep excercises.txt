best tricep excercises

1. Tricep extensions


The triceps extension is a weight training exercise that targets the triceps muscles of the arm. The exercise is performed by sitting with a weight resting on the floor behind you, bending your arms at the elbow, and lowering the weight behind your head. You then use your triceps muscles to extend your arm back to the starting position.

The triceps extension is a good exercise to help build muscle mass and strength in the triceps muscles. It can be performed with a range of weights, depending on your ability and experience.

When performing the triceps extension, be sure to keep your back straight and your elbow close to your head. Do not allow your elbow to move away from your head during the exercise. Also, be sure to use a weight that you can comfortably control. Do not use too much weight, as this can lead to poor form and potential injury.
2. Bench dips


Bench dips are a simple, yet powerful, exercise that can be done almost anywhere. They work the triceps, shoulders, and chest.

To do a bench dip, you will need a bench or other elevated surface, and two weights or dumbbells. Sit on the bench with your hands on the weights, and your feet flat on the ground.

Slowly lower yourself down until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle, and then press back up.
3. Skull crushers


The skull crusher is a popular weightlifting exercise that targets the triceps. This exercise can be performed with a barbell or dumbbell. To perform the skull crusher, hold a weight in each hand with your arms extended above your head. Bend your elbows and lower the weights towards your head. Keep your elbows close to your head and extend your arms to raise the weights back to the starting position.
4. French press


The French press, also known as a plunger pot, is a coffee maker that uses a piston to force hot water through coffee grounds. The coffee is brewed by immersion, meaning that the grounds are steeped in hot water for an extended period of time. This results in a richer, fuller flavor than coffee brewed by other methods.

The French press is a simple and inexpensive coffee maker that can be used to make a single cup or a pot of coffee. It is also easy to clean, making it a popular choice for coffee lovers.

The French press is a great choice for coffee lovers who appreciate a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee. It is also a good choice for those who want to make a single cup of coffee without having to brew a whole pot.
5. Cable crossovers


Cable crossovers are a great chest exercise that can be done with either a cable machine or a band. They work the chest muscles as well as the shoulder muscles.

To do a cable crossover, stand in the middle of a cable machine with the cables set at chest height. Grab the cables and pull them together in front of your chest. Pinch your shoulder blades together and hold for a second. Then slowly release the cables back to the starting position.
